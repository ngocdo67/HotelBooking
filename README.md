The application is run on IntelliJ Spring Boot.

Import the application on IntelliJ (Maven). Wait till Maven setting is done. 
Edit configurations for the Maven app to choose spring-boot:run, then Run the application.

The requests would then be accessible through API call. I used Postman to test the API calls.
